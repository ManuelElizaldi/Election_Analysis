# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A colorado Board of Elections has given us the task of completing the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 
For this we wrote a Python script that delivers the following information when it is ran:

  1. Total number of votes cast.
  2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
  3. Total number of votes each candidate received.
  4. Percentage of votes each candidate won.
  5.The winner of the election based on popular vote.
  6. Voter turnout for each county.
  7. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
  8. The county with the highest turnout
